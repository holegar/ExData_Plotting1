## Exploratory data analysis

For the first project in **Exploratory Data Analysis**, we need to reproduce the four plots in the **figure** folder. 

To reproduce one of the plots, simply run `source('scripts/plot1.R)` from the project directory. Modify the command for plots 2-4. Each of the scripts calls **scripts/load-power-data.R**, which downloads, unzips, and loads the data. The data is stored into **power-data.rds** for quick and convenient access.

The reproducted plots are stored in **plots**.
